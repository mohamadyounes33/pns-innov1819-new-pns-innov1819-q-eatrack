In the file unit_test_CF_rec_test.py, we have a quality test that for given inputs, it execute several algorithms and checks that our system recommendation's failure score is the lowest.

## Tests
unit_test_db_reader.py tests the database reader file.
test_aggregated_voting tests the aggregated voting file.
