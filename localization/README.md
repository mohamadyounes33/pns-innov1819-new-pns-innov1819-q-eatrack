# Getting-GeoLocation
Find your accurate geolocation using selenium and Python. 

Use getlocation.py along with the suitable chromedriver for your chrome version to find your current location based on from where you're accessing the net.

If you are using Chrome version 71 and on Windows, the above uploaded chromedriver.exe will work. Otherwise, kindly download the suitable chromedriver from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads. Also make changes to executable_path parameter in 'webdriver.Chrome()' accordingly.

Step-by-step tutorial for this project can be found on https://link.medium.com/wmVyvu20iU

PS:  Make sure that getlocation.py and the chromedriver.exe are located in the same directory. chromedriver.exe is not to be executed but just stored in the same directory as your python file.

PS : This service uses chromedriver to get user's localization. In order of failure, it returns 
    a static altitude/longitude !
